Binary search trees
===================

* Binary search tree lookup, insertion, and deletion are in the worst case O(n) and average case O(log n) if the tree is balanced
* Searching is the most fundamental application for BST
    * Unlike hash tables, BST offers ability to find the min and max elements, and find the next largest/smallest element in O(log n) time
* With a BST you can iterate through elements in sorted order in time O(n) (regardless if it's balanced)
* Some problems need a combination of a BST and hash table
* Sometimes you need to augment a BST to make it possible to manipulate more complicated data
* The BST is a global property - a binary tree may not be a BST
