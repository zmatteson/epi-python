*Be comfortable with bitwise operators, especially XOR
*Understand how to use masks and create them in a machine independent way
*Know fast ways to clear the lowermost bit set (and by extension, set the lowermost 0, get its index, etc)
*Understand signedness and its implications to shifting
*Consider using a cache to accelerate operations by using it to brute-force small inputs
*Be aware that communattivity and associativity can be used to perform opertations in parallel and reorder operations
